Hi. My name is ****Leo Angelo Bacolores.

I am an aspiring Junior Data Analyst and I wanted to help businesses better understand data to make impactful decisions. I am passionate about technology and business operations which I can leverage to help my clients achieve their goal. What makes me unique is that I am optimistic and always willing to try and learn new things. I am looking for opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge and help bring solutions to data analytics challenges.
